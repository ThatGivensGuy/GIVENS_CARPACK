# GIVENS_CARPACK
FiveM Car Pack

The car pack used in my new upcoming server, Idaho State Roleplay
I've decided since there aren't many free FiveM ready car packs out there, to make it available to anyone wanting to use it
The next big push will be to go through the GTA V compatible 100 motorcycle pack, make it FiveM ready, and sort through the best ones to put into this pack as well.

The things I PLAN on adding to this on top of the motorcycles are:
- Add QBCore compatibility files to auto inject the entire pack into your QBCore
- Add Images for each Vehicle to be used via vimageCreator
- Add OkOkVehicleShop Support
- Add vMenu / ESX 

DISCLAIMER: All of the files in this pack came from GTA5-Mods, all are FREE assets that I DID NOT create myself;
            Full credit to all of the developers who have a vehicle in this pack.
